This repository contains the code for 
* [Controlled Text Generation as Continuous Optimization with Multiple Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01850)
* [Constrained Sampling from Language Models via Langevin Dynamics in Embedding Spaces](#)

# Dependencies

* [pytorch](#) >= 1.6
* [transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) >= 4.5.1
* (optional for some constraints) [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) 
* (optional for some constraints) [POT](https://pythonot.github.io/)

# Quick Start

The main file to run this decoding algorithm is `decode_new.py`. All models used in this code are based on huggingface transformers. 

More instructions by the end of May 2022.
